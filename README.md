SAHAYAK


The abstract of the idea is that we wish to build a system for managing a disaster as well as the victims that are stuck in the calamity. The system is easy to deploy and efficient for administration. The system will allow the admins and the end user to have an easy way to access the most important necessities during the time of the disaster. 
The basic crux of the project is to make a easily deployable webapp, which requires least amount of tech capabilities to running, which can be used during a calamity. 
 The admin portal works like a dash board with all the relevant features like warehouse management, consignment tracking, volunteer portal etc.
 The user portal is a mobile first webapp that will help to request for volunteering, report issues and find nearest shelters. The portal has been designed in such a manner that it is very easy to understand and use.
